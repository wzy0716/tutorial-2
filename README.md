# tutorial-2

- `git branch`: without arguments, it just lists the branches
- `git branch <name>`: command to list a new branch
- `git branch -d <name>`: command to delete a branch

- `git switch`: used to switch between branches
- `git log --oneline --graph --all`: shows the history of commits to the repository, the oneline condenses each commit into a single line, the graph makes it visually easier to look by adding a * symbol, the all command shows the commit history of all branches not just the current one.

- `branch`: a branch in a git allows you to work on a specific task isolated from the main branch. 
- `pull request`: a pull request request that changes from one repository be reviewed and merged to another branch.
